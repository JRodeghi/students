## Background

I'm a 21 year old dude who loves computers and video games. I started programming when I realized I was bad at video games and downloaded some hacks from the internet to pwn some noobs. I was promptly banned from those games due to cheating, and learned about programming through the process of creating your own hacks. I no longer cheat at games, but I am pursuing a BS in computer science because of it :)

## Interests

I love video games, programming [neat lil scripts](https://github.com/Ethan0429/INSTAMEMES), hiking/camping (more camping than hiking...), and skydiving!

## Languages/Tools

C/C++, C#, Java, Python, vscode, Linux systems, AWS, Photoshop
