## Summary/Brief Bio
My name is Jonathan Ward, and I'm a student of the University of Tennessee. I'm currently pursuing a degree in mathematics and minoring in computer science. I'm a raised christian who attends Fairview Baptist Church, and I'm quite fond of natural landscapes, such as the Great Smoky Mountains, and nature in general.

My passion in life is playing video games, and I hope to create some game projects of my own in the future (both big and smallif possible). Just to show a small sample of my work, my [portfolio webpage](https://module-8-11-project-milestone-1-hero-and-mission-jonward.jonward.repl.co) contains three small games that I've created during the web development program of summer 2021. Be warned, however, as my webpage is mostly in its experimental stage (i.e., the social media links that appear at the bottom of the site are not functional yet).
