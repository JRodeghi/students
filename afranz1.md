## Background, interests
I'm a CompSci major with a little bit of experience with website development from an internship in 2021.  I somehow ended up minoring in leadership studies, and I'm considering a cybersecurity minor.  I'm interested in video games and baking.

I have some experience with **C/C++, Java, Python, Git, and VSCode**.
