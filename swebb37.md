## Known Languages
* C
* C++
* Some C#

I hope to learn other languages like python and C#. My goal in 
CS is to eventually create video games, but I'll probably just end 
up working with data or something. I am interested in video
games, reading, video essays, exercise, and becoming better at programming.
