- major: Computer Science 
- minor: Material Science and Engineering

## Background

I started out as a Material Science and Engineering major and I stayed in that program through the 
first semester of my junior year. Over the prior summer I had been learning how to code, and I quickly 
realized that CS was were I belonged. I've been on the CS track ever sence, but I kept MSE as a minor
becuase I still enjoy it and I had basicly already satisfied the requirements. 

## Inerests/Hobbies

I like to draw, play video games, play the drums, and to learn about theoretical physics and pretend 
I actually understand it.

My programming interests include machine learning, trading bots that make (more often loose) me money,
computational modeling, and anything discussed on [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/c/K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai/featured)

## Languages/Skills/Tools

Python, C/C++, JavaScript, a little HTML and CSS, vscode, CUDA, Tensorflow, NEAT-Python
