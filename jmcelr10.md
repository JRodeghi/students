I came to UT from Franklin, TN. I was originally an Electrical Enginnering major. I interned for 4 semesters in the Product Design department at Denso in Maryville, and since I came back, I've switched to Computer Science.

In my spare time, I like to work on cars. Currently, I'm replacing the head gasket on my 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid. [Here's a picture of a similar car.](https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/honda/accord-hybrid/2014/evox/2014_honda_accord-hybrid_sedan_ex-l_pr_evox_1_1280x855.jpg)

###### Here are some software-related things I know about.
- C++
- Microsoft Visual Basic and derivatives (MS Office macro language, VBScript Windows scripting language)
- I can use Python and SQL (Microsoft flavor) in a pinch!
- I know a lot about networking and communication between machines
  - Specifically, I have experience with RS232/UART serial and CANbus.
