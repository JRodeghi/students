#Andrew Artates - CS340 - Assignment 1

Andrew Artates, aartates, Polsyn, Computer Science

I love playing video games and found computer science class to be pretty fun in high school so I decided that ComSci would be a good major, although after discovering that much of the video game development field is miserable, I think I will avoid working in that particular field.

My interests include:
 - Fishing
 - Video Games
 - Coding
 - Chatting on Discord
 - Anime
 - Bowling
 - Spending Time with Family

Disclaimer: These interests are not necessarily in order of least to greatest...

If you are looking for a good laugh, please enjoy this miserable website I had to create in high school for my webdev class. [Father Ryan and Me!](https://artate15110project.weebly.com/)

I am familiar (but rusty) with the following programming languages:
 - C++
 - C
 - Java
 - Crestron (it's not really much a programming language so much as a program for programming audio visual equipment)
