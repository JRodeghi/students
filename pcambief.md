 ## Background
	Hello. My name is Pierluigi Cambie-Fabris, but I go by PG. 
	I've been at a student at UTK since the spring of 2020. 
	I originally entered as a solo mathematics major but was able to transfer into the college of engineering and also study computer science. 
	One of my interests in the past years has been visiting [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy/) as I have done so for the past 7-8 years.
