-   **Background:** I grew up as a math and music enthusiast. In high school I participated in a lot of math, music, and robotics competitions in high school. Using my theoretical mathematical background combined with my computer science, I hope to go into a data science field. Finally, I am also a programmer on the Ynot robotics team, and I work for a contracting firm that makes custom electronics.

-   **Interests:** I like to compose and produce music. I run a YouTube channel where I produce music videos called Sheets Music. I enjoy running, and I also like to play soccer on the club soccer team at UT. My new favorite hobby is a new sport I discovered called Teqball.
