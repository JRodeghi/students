My background in the CS field goes back to high school where I worked in the Student Helpdesk that serviced the student body's laptops. I served 5 semesters in there, and that also spawned two internships during my post-Junior year and post-Senior year summers, respectively, where I worked across the entire school system with the full time techs. Then I came to UT for Computer Science. Since the beginning of this year, I also have been working in IT for the MBA program here through the Federal Work Study program. I aim to get into either Software Development or IT when I graduate.

My interests are rather varied, ranging from [Olympic-Style Fencing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing)], History, Heavy Metal Music, Video Games, Table-Top RPGs, to Martial Arts.
