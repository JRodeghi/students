Major: Computer Science

I'm a Junior studying computer science. I first learned to code in Junior year of high
school when I took AP Computer Science Principles, which was entirely in Java. I then 
learned C++ through the introductory courses at UT. At the start of my Sophomore year
of college, I was able to participate in an engineering co op with a networking 
company called Adtran in Huntsville, Alabama, where I greatly expanded on my skills as
a programmer in practical and professional contexts. I'm greatly interested in home-
centric hobbies such as reading/writing, video games, algorithm-based puzzles (i.e. 
Rubik's cubes, wooden puzzles, etc.) and media critique.
