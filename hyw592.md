##Background / Interests	
* Technology has always been a part of my background. Computers and technology in general have always come easy to me. I can easily problem solve most technology related problems. That is probably why computer science comes pretty easy for me. It involves technology and problem solving. I was also in scouts and earned my Eagle Scout. In scouts we went camping and backpacking a lot, which made me enjoy and like the outdoors. I like to go on backpacking trips to the middle of no where and camp under the stars. It's nice not to hear any civilization and see the stars because there is no light pollution.
* I learned multiple coding languages in highschool and the first 3 years of college.
 1. Javascript
 2. Python
 3. Java
 4. HTML / CSS
 5. C/C++
 6. Assembly (mostly AVR and a little MIPS)
 7. C# with Unity
* One of my main hobbies/interests is 3d printing and would like to do something with that as an actual job. I also started to get into basic Arduino robotics, but would only like to do that as a hobby, not a job.
* I know how to 3d model, but one of the most popular places to get pre-made 3d models ready for printing is [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).
