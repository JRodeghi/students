#Nik Bergman Background Info

- Github: nikbergman42
- Major: Computer Science

I got into computer science from playing video games and creating programs as a kid, and have continued to enjoy it since. 
Now, I enjoy playing games on my desktop and using code to solve problems(and coding things within games is a big plus)
In the past, I have worked with c++ in classes, python for some personal projects, and lua for some small side projects. Namely, my friends and I made a roblox game
using the roblox engine and lua. It's not good, but yo ucan check it out [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/6476538538/Run-from-the-Laser-OBBY).
