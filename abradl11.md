# CS340 Introduction

## My Information

- name: Abram Bradley

- BA Neuroscience, pursuing Computer Science MS

## Background

I started coding the summer before I started college, just as a hobby. The first language I learned was GML (GameMaker Language). Towards my junior year of undergrad I started learning Python. I got really comfortable with the language, but I didn't know any frameworks or API's. After I got out of undergrad I did not know what I wanted to do, that's when I get really into web development. I eventually landed a research job at UT working for Dr. Penumadu. Now I'm back to school working on my Master's.

## Interests

My primary interest is probably programming and web development, but I also run and play video games. I also like following US politics and I try to keep up with what's going on.
