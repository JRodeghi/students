# About Me
I am a second year computer science student who began programming when I was in the fourth grade. I have had two different jobs related to programming, in highschool I worked
teaching kids ages seven to fourteen how to program. I now work in the CORSYS(Compilers operating systems and runtime systems) lab at the University of Tennessee. My research
is in NUMA(non uniform memory architectures) in managed languages. I specifically work on the Java hotspot jvm which means I spend alot of time working on C and C++ code.

As far as interests go I really enjoy systems programming, but am open to programming from across the field. I also work with my colleagues in the research lab on an in
terminal text editor called [YED](https://github.com/your-editor) which I really enjoy working on plugins and improving!

## Tools I have used
- C
- C++
- git
- python
