### More about me:
I enjoy houseplants and gardening and I am really looking forward to harvesting my hydroponically grown strawberries in a few weeks! I'm also very into cooking. 
I'm passionate about participating in **regional Burning Man events**. (Check out To The Moon this summer, only an hour and a half from Knoxville! https://www.tothemoonburn.com/) 
I even mess around with fire spinning, although I'm not very good. 
Sometimes I make giant paper mache puppet heads. I have worked on and off with Knoxville's own Catywampus Puppet Council: https://cattywampuspuppetcouncil.com/
