## Background Information

I am Junior from Nashville, TN and this is my second semester back at UT after enlisting in the Air Force
where I worked as an Avionics Technician on the F-35 JSF. I listen to music and play video games in my free time, typically
through [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), respectively. I enjoy the occasional
hike whenever I decide not to be a caveman.
